This course introduces the rapidly emerging professional field of Trust and Safety, which every major social media company—such as Instagram, Slack, Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube—has dedicated teams for, as do companies like OpenAI, which provide services with significant safety concerns. Trust and Safety is an interdisciplinary profession where engineers work together with policy teams and communications professionals to answer difficult questions.
