Trust and Safety is a rapidly emerging professional field. Every major social media company (e.g., Instagram, Slack, Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, etc etc) has Trust and Safety teams, and so do companies like OpenAI who provide services where there are significant safety concerns. Trust and Safety is an interdisciplinary profession, where engineers work together with policy teams and communications professionals to answer difficult questions.
